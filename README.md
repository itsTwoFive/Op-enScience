Individual practice for the course Open Science and Artificial Intelligence at UPM.
## The scripts
This repository contains 3 Scripts that using already analyzed pdf with grobid will do the next tasks:
1. Draw a keyword cloud based on the abstract information
2. Create a visualization showing the number of figures per article.
3. Create a list of the links (references)* found in each paper.

*In order to proceed with the exercise I changed the expected behivor of the 3rd script becouse I couldn't find the way to fetch thelinks from the grobisd output files, so now it Lists all the references and it's authors in a txt document.
